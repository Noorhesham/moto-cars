                    <p>
                      This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Website to achieve the purposes
                      described below. Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by
                      using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they
                      interact with this Website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document – unless
                      there is a reason to differentiate.
                      <br />
                      For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to
                      talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this
                      reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to
                      indicate that particular type of Tracker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent. Whenever
                      consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in
                      this document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This Website uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and
                      Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless
                      otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by
                      them.
                      <br />
                      The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on
                      the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of
                      the User’s browsing session.
                      <br />
                      In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may
                      find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other
                      relevant information — such as the presence of other Trackers — in the linked privacy policies of
                      the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.
